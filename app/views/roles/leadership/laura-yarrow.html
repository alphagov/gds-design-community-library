    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-hint">Head of Design for GOV.UK</h2>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Role at GDS</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">Laura is the Head of Design for GOV.UK. This is a massive undertaking and covers the
      Publishing teams, Insights and Analytics, Accessibility Monitoring team, Branding and Social team, Content
      operation, Policy and Strategy team and GOV.UK Design System team.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Laura is keen to ensure that we have a cross cutting channel approach to GOV.UK, tapping into
      the social aspect that we've been missing. She has been advocating for a stronger brand presence, and working out
      where we can build our presence across users lives. She has also been developing strong relationships with other
      Heads of Design across government, building on our reputation and listening to what we are missing.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Biography</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">Over the past five years in government, Laura has led design at both GDS and HM Land Registry,
      applying her expertise in user-centred design to deliver accessible, effective services across the public sector.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Her career spans more than two decades in the digital industry spanning web development, user
      research and design, providing her with deep experience in developing intuitive products that meet real human
      needs.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">What drives her work is a curiosity about people: how they think, what they need, and why they
      behave the way they do. This people-first approach underpins her commitment to creating experiences that are
      simple, accessible, inclusive, and genuinely useful.</p>
