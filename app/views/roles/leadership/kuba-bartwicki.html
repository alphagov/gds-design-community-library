    <p class="govuk-body">Kuba is the Head of Design for Products and Services. This covers such a wide variety of
      products, such as the GOV.UK app, Chat, Forms, Pay, Notify, Emergency Alerts and AI Frontiers. He is a very
      adaptable person, making sure he is up to date with the newest plans for AI and how we can incorporate them into
      our work.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Kuba also makes sure that our longstanding products receive an equal amount of support and
      love from senior management. He has stressed the importance of growing the platforms where we can, meaning that
      users are able to continue to use our platforms, rather than rely on third party ones. He ensures that
      accessibility is a through consideration in all work, leaving no user behind.</p>
